## Hi, I'm Annie 

₊⊹⁺˖ 

I am a solution-seeking software engineer, driven by the need to learn, grow, share, and create. My core guiding principle is to always leave the Web better than I found it, so behind every delightful interface I build is extra attention to accessibility and sustainability.
